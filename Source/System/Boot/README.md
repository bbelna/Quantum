## Quantum Bootloaders

## Overview
This folder contains bootloader implementations separated by architecture.

## Specification
**TODO:** Add more detail regarding how bootloaders work, especially how the
bootloader needs to pass information to the kernel.

All bootloaders must load the kernel (kernel.qx) and the init bundle (init.bnd)
in order for the system to run.
