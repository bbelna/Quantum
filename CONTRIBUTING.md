# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

If you are interested in working on Quantum:

1. Browse the Issues to find work that interests you.
2. Check the Quantum Development project to understand current priorities and milestones.
3. Pick up an unassigned issue or open a new one if you identify missing work.
4. Create a branch, make focused changes, and open a pull request.

There is no rigid contribution bureaucracy. Follow existing conventions, keep changes scoped and readable, and favor clarity over cleverness. Discussion and iteration are part of the process. Documentation regarding coding standards and conventions is forthcoming and will be located in this wiki.

Even small contributions, including documentation improvements or cleanup refactors, are valuable.
