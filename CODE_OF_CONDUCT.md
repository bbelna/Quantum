# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of Quantum pledge to make
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful, kind, and constructive.
- Giving and receiving feedback with empathy.
- Assuming good intent and asking clarifying questions before escalating.
- Focusing on what’s best for the project and the community.
- Using welcoming language and making space for others to participate.
- Disagreeing productively: critique ideas, not people.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech of any kind.
- Personal attacks, insults, or “dunking” on others.
- Trolling, flaming, or deliberately derailing discussions.
- Publishing others’ private information (“doxxing”) without consent.
- Sexualized language or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Threats of violence, encouragement of self-harm, or intimidation.
- Persistent bad-faith arguing or repeatedly ignoring maintainer guidance.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and code review
- Commit messages and repository content
- Community chat spaces (if any) and any other official project channels

It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior, and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, you may report it in one of
the following ways:

- **Report directly** using [GitHub’s built-in reporting tools](\
https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/\
reporting-abuse-or-spam) (recommended for serious or sensitive situations), or
- **Contact the project maintainer(s)** privately via the repository owner's
email (bbelna@aol.com), or
- **Open an issue** labeled `conduct` if you feel safe doing so.

Project maintainers will review and address reports that are brought to them in
good faith. Reports will be handled as promptly and confidentially as possible.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers may apply the following actions (not necessarily in order),
depending on severity and context:

1. **Correction**: A private or public note explaining what went wrong and what
to change.
2. **Warning**: A clear statement that continued behavior will lead to further
action.
3. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary restriction from project interaction
(issues/PRs/discussions).
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from all project participation spaces.
5. **Content Removal**: Deleting or editing posts, comments, commits, or other
content that violates this policy.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was incorrect or unfair, you may appeal by
contacting the repository owner privately with relevant context. Appeals will be
reviewed in good faith.
