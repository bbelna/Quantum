Quantum is a clean, from-scratch C++ operating system focused on
clarity, coherence, and deliberate design. Rather than re-implementing or
imitating existing operating system architectures, Quantum is built with its own
abstractions, conventions, and long-term structure in mind.

See the [Quantum wiki](https://github.com/bbelna/Quantum/wiki) for more information.
