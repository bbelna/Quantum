## Overview
Quantum is a clean, from-scratch hobbyist C++ operating system focused on
clarity, coherence, and deliberate design. Rather than re-implementing or
imitating existing operating system architectures, Quantum is built with its own
abstractions, conventions, and long-term structure in mind.

## Documentation

Project documentation lives in the **Quantum Wiki**:

https://github.com/bbelna/Quantum/wiki

The wiki describes the system architecture, design philosophy, roadmap,
internal structure of the codebase, and contributing guidelines.
