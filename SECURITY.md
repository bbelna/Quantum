# Security Policy

This document details Quantum's security policy.

Please note that Quantum is licensed under the MIT license, and as such, it is
provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. See `COPYRIGHT.md` for more
information.

## Supported Versions

Quantum is an early-stage project and does not currently publish versioned
releases. As such, no specific versions are formally supported at this time.

## Project Scope

Quantum is currently a research and hobbyist operating system project and is
**not** designed, intended, or recommended for production, commercial, or
security-critical use. Because of this, security issues are treated as normal development issues rather than sensitive disclosures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or potential vulnerability in Quantum, you may
report it by opening a GitHub issue describing the problem.

When reporting a security issue, please include as much relevant detail as
possible, such as:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce, if known
- The affected components or files
- Any potential impact you are aware of

Reports will be reviewed and addressed on a best-effort basis.

## Disclosure

Because Quantum is under active development and not intended for production use,
fixes may be made directly on the main branch, and issues may be discussed openly
in public.
